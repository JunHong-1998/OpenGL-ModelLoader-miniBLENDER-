# OpenGL-ModelLoader-miniBLENDER-
A developed mini BLENDER that reads raw models with transformation and lighting editable ...
The windowing system is handled by pygame as well as the implementation of key function and audio system while opengl is fully utilised in building the application preferences and the graphics content of the application. Generally, there are 3 main classes that are from ‘ModelLoader_main.py’, ‘ModelLoader_ObjLoader.py’ and ‘ModelLoader_UserInterface.py’. External library such as numpy, math, random, PIL and os are used for further mathematical calculation, generating random numbers, image processing and file directory path related event. The 3D hierarchy model is drawn originally by myself as well as the creation of application. The model is a predator that spent 2 weeks to finish with total of 26 hierarchy parts that fulfilled the assignment requirement for hierarchy model. There are 6 functions available in this program that allow user to manipulate the model including position, size, degree of view, colour, texture and lighting. Moreover there are 3 more functions that enhance the view of model including to adjust the viewport, add background and base plane and adjust preferences.
